When considering a health insurance policy, it is essential to understand the eligibility criteria. The minimum entry age for adults is 18 years, while for children it is 90 days. The maximum entry age for adults is 65 years, and for children, it is 17 years. Individuals with a disability of 40% or more, certified under the Disability Act 2016, and persons with HIV confirmed by a diagnostic test report are eligible. The proposer's age should be 18 years or above. The policy term is 1 year, and premium payment can be made in different installments. The policy covers individuals, with a maximum of 6 persons covered.

The policy provides coverage for various disabilities as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 and the Mental Healthcare Act 2017. It covers disabilities such as blindness, muscular dystrophy, low vision, chronic neurological conditions, leprosy cured persons, specific learning disabilities, hearing impairment, multiple sclerosis, locomotor disability, speech and language disability, dwarfism, thalassemia, intellectual disability, haemophilia, mental illness, sickle cell disease, autism spectrum disorder, multiple disabilities including deaf/blindness, cerebral palsy, acid attack victims, and Parkinson's disease. A disability certificate issued by the government-appointed medical board is mandatory to avail this cover.

The policy also covers individuals with HIV/AIDS. It provides coverage for hospitalization, including in-patient care, AYUSH treatment, pre-hospitalization and post-hospitalization medical expenses, and emergency ground ambulance.

It is important to be aware of the benefits and exclusions of the policy. The maximum liability of the company for any claim made during the policy year is limited to the sum insured mentioned in the policy schedule. Claims are subject to the terms, conditions, exclusions, sub-limits, and waiting periods of the policy. There are waiting periods for pre-existing disabilities, pre-existing conditions, and specified diseases and procedures. The policy also has standard exclusions such as treatments for hazardous or adventure sports, treatment arising from a breach of law, treatment from excluded providers, treatment for alcoholism or substance abuse, treatments in health hydros or similar establishments, dietary supplements without prescription, treatment for refractive error below a certain level, unproven treatments, sterility and infertility treatments, and maternity expenses. The policy also covers specific treatments like cataract treatment and modern treatments like uterine artery embolization and robotic surgeries.

There are optional covers available, such as the co-payment waiver, which waives off the mandatory co-payment of 20%. Another option is the deductible, which allows you to choose a claim amount that you will be responsible for. Claims will be settled or rejected within a certain time frame. The policy is generally renewable, but there are conditions and grace periods for premium payment. There is a free look period of 15 days, during which you can review the policy terms and conditions. If no claims are made during this period, you are entitled to a refund of the premium paid, with deductions for any expenses incurred by the insurance company. If you have any grievances, you can approach the Insurance Ombudsman or submit a written complaint to the policy issuing office or regional office.

It is important to nominate a person for claim payment in the event of your death. Any changes in nomination must be communicated to the insurance company in writing. The policy may be revised or modified with the approval of the authority, and you will be notified about any revisions or modifications. Existing policies will remain in force until their expiry, and revisions will only be applicable from the date of the next renewal. For cashless claims, preauthorization from the insurance company or their authorized Third Party Administrator (TPA) is required. Treatment must be taken in a network provider. If cashless access is denied, you can obtain treatment and submit the claim documents for reimbursement. For reimbursement of claims, you must submit the necessary documents within the prescribed time limit, including a duly completed claim form, photo identity proof of the patient, medical practitioner's prescription, original bills, payment receipts, and other supporting documentation.

Once the claim documents are received, the insurer will assess the admissibility of the claim. If the claim is deemed admissible, the insurer will make the payment of benefits. If the claim is rejected, the insurer will inform you in writing with the reason for the rejection. The TPA is responsible for servicing the claims under the policy, including claim admissions and assessments. However, the TPA's services do not include claim settlement or rejection.

It is important to note that coverage and reimbursement for medical procedures and treatments may vary depending on the specific policy chosen. It is recommended to refer to the policy terms and conditions for full details and clarification
